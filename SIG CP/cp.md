I attempted the hackerrank problems over more than a week. As a beginner in programming, the first 2-3 problems was a little easy for me. The last few ones took me a few days to understand and come up with a logic. But I did try my best with alot of help of google (obviously). Solving this contest and the code area task, I learned quite a lot
